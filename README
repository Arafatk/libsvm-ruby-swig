This is the Ruby port of the LIBSVM Python SWIG interface
A modified version of LIBSVM is included, it contains changes merged from:
  git://github.com/npinto/libsvm-2.88_objs-np.git
  git://github.com/alanfalloon/libsvm-2.88_output_model_params.git
to expose additional data/parameters in the model object. 

Look for the README file in the ruby subdirectory for instructions
The binaries included were built under Ubuntu Linux 2.6.24-23-generic,
you should run make under the libsvm-2.88 and libsvm-2.88/ruby 
directories to regenarate the excutables for your environment.
